# Bar-Chart-Project
Bar Chart Stretch Project Lighthouse Labs
This is an app that is used to generate bar charts based on user input.
Within the customize chart portion of the webpage the user may:
-modify the title of the chart (name, colour and size)
-add single or multi value (stacked) bars to the chart by entering a label and corresponding value
-choose label and bar colours and catagory colours if bar is stacked
-choose height and width of chart
-choose location of value within bar (top, middle, bottom)
-choose bar width

note: When using eslint I got an error for using ` to replace quotation marks in order to use javascript within the quote
